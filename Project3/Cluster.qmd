# Introduction and Data

-   Using Grower/PAM clustering for categorical (one-hot encoded) data, I am looking to identify distinct "customer-classes" by analyzing individual, self reported data on their coffee drinking habits (location, preferred roast, preferred drinking location, reason for drinking coffee) and demographic characteristics such as their age, gender, educational background, and number of children. Identifying prominent characteristics that lead to vast differences in consumer spending can be beneficial to any corporation looking to target the right kind of consumers through advertising.

# Methodology

-   Clustering provides a way to group individual observations into natural "clusters" through distances in their observable features. These differences between features can be defined in many ways, however for the main analysis we will be using Grower / PAM clustering to identify differences between observations. For example, if two individuals report that they prefer dark roast, they will have a relatively short distance and could potentially end up in the same cluster, provided other survey responses are similar. This is done for every observation, and all of our chosen covariates. Individuals with similar coffee preferences and habits will be clustered together into one of 3 clusters, hopefully providing us with 3 unique/distinct customer groups.

## Rock Clustering Analysis

```{r}
#Preprocess & Load Data:
source("functions/preprocess.R")
library(cba)
library(dplyr)
library(cluster)
set.seed(2)

#Columns selected for clustering (categorical only)
vars <- c(
  "where_drink", #Where do you drink coffee?
  "number_children", #How many children do you have?
  "brew", #Favorite brew?
  "additions", #Favorite addition to your coffee?
  "style", #Favoriate coffee style?
  "roast_level", #Preffered roast level?
  "caffeine", #How much caffine do you like in your coffe?
  "expertise", #How would you rate your own coffee expertise?
  "why_drink", #Why do you drink coffee?
  "taste", #Do you like the taste of coffee?
  "know_source", #Do you know where your coffee is sourced from?
  "value_cafe", #Do you feel cafe coffee is good value?
  "gender", #What is your gender?
  "education_level", #What is your education level?
  "employment_status",#What is your employment status?
  'most_paid', #What is the most you've ever paid for a cup of coffee?
  'ethnicity_race', #What is your ethnicity/race
  'spent_equipment', #how much spent on coffee equipment in the past 5 years?
  "wfh", #Do you work from home?
  'cups', #How many cups of coffee do you typically drink a day?
  'age', #What is your age?
  "total_spend", #how much do you typically spend on coffee in a month?
  'favorite' # What is your favorite coffee drink?
)

#Subset and clean data
coffee <- coffee_survey[, vars]
coffee_clean <- na.omit(coffee)

#Ensure all variables are factors
coffee_clean[] <- lapply(coffee_clean, function(x) {
  if (is.character(x)) as.factor(x) else x
})

#Compute Gower distance
gower_dist <- daisy(coffee_clean, metric = "gower")
gower_matrix <- as.matrix(gower_dist)

#Use PAM for Gower
pam_model <- pam(gower_dist, k = 3, diss = TRUE)
coffee_clean$cluster <- pam_model$clustering
table(coffee_clean$cluster)

#Add cluster assignments
coffee_clean$cluster <- factor(pam_model$clustering)

#One-hot encode for PCA
coffee_onehot <- model.matrix(~ . - 1, data = coffee_clean[, -ncol(coffee_clean)])  # Exclude cluster column

#Run PCA to visualize clusters in 2 dimensions
pca_result <- prcomp(coffee_onehot, center = TRUE, scale. = TRUE)

#Creating data frame for ggplot
pca_df <- data.frame(
  PC1 = pca_result$x[, 1],
  PC2 = pca_result$x[, 2],
  Cluster = coffee_clean$cluster
)

#Plot
ggplot(pca_df, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = Cluster)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6, size = 2) +
  labs(title = "PAM Clustering Visualization (PCA)",
       x = "Principal Component 1", y = "Principal Component 2") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1")
```

# Results

-   From initial observations, it appears that factoring/one-hot encoding survey data does not provide enough distance between each observation to distinctively separate them into unique, well defined clusters. After attempting to use ROCK clustering from the CBA package, and obtaining similar results, I switched to Grower/PAM which handles one-hot encoded categorical data and obtained similar results. We can see that there is a very large amount of overlap between the 3 clusters, and through further parameter tuning / changing of the amount of clusters, I have been unable to identify well-defined, separate groupings based on this survey data. Outliers seem to be members of all 3 clusters, and there does not seem to be any real evidence that members of each cluster are truly different from one another based on the current observable characteristics / principal components created for the 2d visual plot.

-   This likely occurs because members of the 2023 survey of “Great American Coffee Taste Test” viewers were all likely similar in many aspects, including observable aspects like coffee preferences and consumer habits. If the viewers are all very similar in their coffee preferences, and we force our clustering algorithm to sort them into clusters regardless, we end up with a cloud of multiple clusters, with no defined unique groupings. Even with further survey data, if the individuals of the survey are all closely similar to each other in their daily coffee consuming habits, we likely will not be able to create well defined clusters. It is obvious that this sample alone cannot be used to make predictions on the behavior of other American coffee consumers due to the selection bias within our sample of these survey respondents.
