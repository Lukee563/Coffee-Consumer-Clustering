Initial taste was incredibly bitter, but lessened significantly as it cooled, but oddly enough, only once it got close to room temperature. It was still bitter as it was cooling, but then seemed to hit a point abruptly when the bitterness seemed to subside.

As I would return to this cup, it may have had an unfair uphill battle as I would think to myself “oh, this was the bitter one. Yep, still bitter”.

 I had thought it was my least favorite of the four, but towards the end of the stream (but before the coffees were revealed) as I compared it to Coffee C, the two seemed to almost switch places on me. C became what my initial impression of B was, and B became what my initial impression of C was. This could have been due to the fact that I was giving A and D more of my attention because I enjoyed them more and was more eager to return to them and crown a favorite, whereas I wasn’t as excited to return to B and C.",3,3,2,"Tasted dark and winey.

Tasted like a very juicy, dark blueberry and also of raspberries. Had a difficult time choosing a favorite between A and D. 

While these were obviously prepared the same way, I almost liken their flavors to that of a pour over vs an espresso. Coffee A was a great, well rounded coffee that I could drink every time I made coffee, ie a pour over. D was a more bold, explosion of flavor that was a delight to drink, but may tire out my tastebuds if I drank it every time I made coffee, ie espresso.","Coffee A","Coffee D","Coffee D","I primarily work from home","<$20","It tastes good",NA,"Yes","Yes","$6-$8","More than $20","No","$500-$1000","Yes","Male",NA,"Bachelor's degree","White/Caucasian",NA,"Employed full-time","None","Independent"

As it cooled, the bitterness went down, but when I drank this hot, the bitterness + dark roast was pretty much all I noticed. 
I'm not super well versed in the type of coffee that this is?

Loved how interesting it tasted, and got a ton of berry notes out of it.
