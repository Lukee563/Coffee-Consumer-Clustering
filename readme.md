-   Currently working with a Coffee Consumer Survey Data Set from The Great American Coffee Taste Test (https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/main/data/2024/2024-05-14/readme.md) to establish if individuals can be grouped into customer classes based on high-level survey data. Using Grower/PMA cluster analysis, individuals are grouped into clusters through high-level survey responses such as their daily coffee consumption information, their preferred location to drink/purchase coffee, and their preferred drinks and roasts.
